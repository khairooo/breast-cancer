# Automated-Machine-Learning-for-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Using-TPOT
This project classifies breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using machine learning.

## Features

- Utilizes the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)
- Implements TPOT for automated machine learning
- Flask web app for making predictions
- Saves the trained model as a `.pkl` file

  ## Dataset

The project uses the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD), which includes measurements from tumor samples. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)**.
